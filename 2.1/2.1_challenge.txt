CHALLENGE
Create the following Pods and resource constraints. If there are errors, fix and make all Pods run

IMAGES
- busybox

SCENARIO
- Create the following namespace:
 qos-example

- Create the following namespace constraints:
  limit range:
     default limit:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 500Mi
     default request:
        cpu: 250m
        memory: 250Mi
     max:
        cpu: 750m
        memory: 550Mi
     min:
        cpu: 150m
        memory: 200Mi
  resource quotas:
    memory requests:  1.2Gi
    memory limits: 1.5Gi
    cpu requests: 1100m
    cpu limits:  1400m

- Create the following Pods:
  Create 3 pods with the default resource settings as described in the limit range. The pods should have the following:
    - busybox image
    - run indefinately
    - restartPolicy: OnFailure
    - Do not set resource requests or limits until all 3 pods are created in qos-example namespace
    - Fix errors as they happen


VALIDATE
  - Have 3 running pods in qos-example namespace
  - Check resourcquota values for qos-example and if if you over exceed limits
  - What is the QOS for each pod?
