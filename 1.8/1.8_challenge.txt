CHALLENGE
Create all the environment variables from one file automatically and use logs to view the environment variables

IMAGES
- busybox

SCENARIO

Busybox Container
- Create all the environment variables from game.properties file

- use from-file not from-env-file for "k create configmap"

NOTE: 
  By using the --from-file instead of the --from-env-file, we have the file name as the "environment variable" and the value being the contents
  of the file; if we, however, used --from-env-file and envFrom, we would have had all the variables available directly in the shell

  why is this? it has to do with how --from-file and --from-env-file store the data in the pod spec. --from-file stores the data as a multi-line yaml string and
  --from-env-file stores each entry from the corresponding file as key/value pairs

- Print these Environment variables to the stdout

VALIDATE
- Connect to the containers logs and view the environment variables:
  enemies=aliens
  lives=3
  enemies.cheat=true
  enemies.cheat.level=noGoodRotten
  secret.code.passphrase=UUDDLRLRBABAS
  secret.code.allowed=true

- return the variables from the logs
